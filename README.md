# Caesar's Cipher
Caesar's Cipher is a simple encrypt method where you shift each letter of the text with an according numerical key.

For example, the word "HELLO" when encrypted using Caesar's Cipher and a numerical key of 1 will become "IFMMP".

# System Algorithm (How it operates)
We use the [Decimal ASCII Chart](https://www.asciichart.com/[asciichart.com) in the implementation of the algorithm.
